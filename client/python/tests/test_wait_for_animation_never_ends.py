"""Test that waitForAnimationToEnd times out when animation never stops.

A tiny offline Android app (dev.maestro.animationtest) shows a full-screen
WebView rendering a perpetually rotating CSS spinner. Because the animation
never ceases, the driver can never reach a "two consecutive identical
screenshots" steady state, so waitForAnimationToEnd must time out and return
success=False.

The WebView's CSS animation is independent of the system animator/window/
transition scales, so it keeps rotating even when the emulator runs with
`disable-animations: true` (which would suppress a native Android animation).
No network or local HTTP server is involved -- the HTML is embedded in the app.

Prerequisites:
  1. Android emulator running  (``adb devices`` shows a device)
  2. maestro-runner binary built and on PATH (or conftest will auto-start)
  3. Python deps installed:  pip install requests pytest
  4. drivers/android/animation-test-app-debug.apk installed on the emulator

Run:
  pytest tests/test_wait_for_animation_never_ends.py -v

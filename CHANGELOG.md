## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.19] - 2026-07-01

A reporter-driven follow-up focused on executor/`runScript` parity with Maestro and iOS simulator ergonomics. Headlines: `runScript`'s JavaScript environment now matches Maestro (env vars are scoped per script and undeclared variables read as `undefined` instead of throwing), `when:`/`while:` condition checks resolve **fast by default** instead of blocking on the 7s optional-find timeout, and `--auto-start-emulator` finally works for iOS simulators. Plus an iOS runner build-cache correctness fix.

### Fixed
- **`runScript` env leaked across scripts; optional vars threw `ReferenceError`** — `runScript` env vars were applied as sticky globals that were never cleared, so a value set in one script bled into the next; and referencing an env var that wasn't provided this run threw `ReferenceError: X is not defined`. Env is now scoped to the single script run and restored afterward, and undeclared identifiers evaluate to `undefined` (matching Maestro's GraalJS behavior), so `someVar || default` and `typeof someVar` work for optional env vars. Real globals and the script's own declarations are untouched. Reported by [@rafaelnobrekz](https://github.com/rafaelnobrekz) ([#109](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/109)).
- **`--auto-start-emulator` errored for iOS simulators** — the iOS WDA pre-check decided simulator-vs-real-device before any simulator was started and didn't account for `--auto-start-emulator`, so `--platform ios --parallel 2 --auto-start-emulator` exited demanding `--team-id` before the (working) auto-start path could boot the simulators. `--auto-start-emulator` and `--start-simulator` now count as simulator targets on iOS (a real device can't be auto-created), so neither requires `--team-id` or `--app-file`. Reported by [@rafaelnobrekz](https://github.com/rafaelnobrekz) ([#111](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/111)).
- **DeviceLab iOS runner build cache could serve a stale build** — the cache keyed on the simulator iOS version alone, so a release shipping updated runner sources into the same `sim-ios<ver>` slot would reuse the previous build. The cache key now also includes a content hash of the vendored runner source, so it invalidates exactly when the runner changes and is reused otherwise.

### Changed
- **`when:`/`while:` condition checks are fast by default** — a `runFlow` `when:` (or `repeat` `while:`) condition with no explicit timeout fell through to the driver's 7s optional-find timeout, so every unmet condition blocked ~7s (a flow with several optional `when:` branches paid 7s each). These checks now use a short default timeout (1000ms); a present element still resolves immediately, only an unmet condition is bounded. Tunable globally with `--condition-timeout` (env `MAESTRO_CONDITION_TIMEOUT`) and still overridable per condition with `timeout:`. Reported by [@rafaelnobrekz](https://github.com/rafaelnobrekz) ([#110](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/110)).
- **Faster cold DeviceLab iOS runner builds** — the runner now builds against the concrete booted simulator (`-destination platform=iOS Simulator,id=<udid>`) instead of a generic destination, so `xcodebuild` skips re-planning an abstract device.

## [1.1.18] - 2026-06-24

A reporter-driven correctness release. The headline theme is **tap and scroll geometry on Android** — taps and `scrollUntilVisible` no longer treat on-screen elements near the bottom edge (or with a momentarily inverted first-frame rect) as off-screen, so bottom-anchored buttons, tall-dialog actions, and below-the-fold list items resolve reliably. Alongside that: the **"Update available" banner now prints a working install URL**, iOS real-device permission dialogs arm correctly when `launchApp` lives in `onFlowStart`/`runFlow`, variable interpolation works in `repeat` `while:` conditions and `runScript` env, WDA failures surface the closest on-screen texts, and JUnit reports keep flow subdirectories in the `file` property.

### Fixed
- **Update banner printed a 404 install URL** — the "Update available" notice told users to run `curl ... https://open.devicelab.dev/maestro-runner/install`, but the path segments were swapped and that URL 404s. It now points at the working `https://open.devicelab.dev/install/maestro-runner`. Reported by [@George-Anton-Tarazi](https://github.com/George-Anton-Tarazi) ([#102](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/102)).
- **Android: taps rejected near the bottom edge of the display** — `boundsTappable` compared full-display element bounds against the on-device-reported *usable* height (e.g. `1080x2204` on a `2340`-tall screen), so `AlertDialog` buttons in tall dialogs and bottom-anchored FABs became untappable on the DeviceLab driver even though UIAutomator2 tapped them fine. Taps are now validated against the *physical* display size (`wm size`, cached), matching the coordinate space the accessibility hierarchy produces. Reported and fixed by [@MarioRial22](https://github.com/MarioRial22) ([#100](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/100), [#101](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/101)).
- **Android: `scrollUntilVisible` looped on elements already on screen** — `isElementOnScreen` used the usable height while element bounds are in full-display coords, so an item in the bottom system-bar band (e.g. the last nav-drawer item) was treated as off-screen and the scroll loop ran to its cap on a visible element. It now validates against the physical display, same as the tap guard.
- **Android: `scrollUntilVisible` short-circuited on a malformed rect** — `isElementOnScreen` rejected only zero-area bounds, not negative ones, so a clipped below-the-fold child reported with `top > bottom` (a negative-height rect) was accepted as "on screen" and the scroll never happened. Both the DeviceLab and UIAutomator2 drivers now treat non-positive width/height as off-screen, mirroring the tap-side guard.
- **Android: keyboard not dismissed when Appium `hide_keyboard` no-ops** — Appium's `/appium/device/hide_keyboard` returns success without closing the keyboard on some devices (notably several Samsung models), so the next coordinate tap hit the keyboard overlay. `hideKeyboard` now verifies via `dumpsys` and, only while the keyboard is confirmed still up, falls back to `KEYCODE_BACK` (gated so it can't trigger a stray back-navigation). Reported by [@satishs22](https://github.com/satishs22) ([#42](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/42)).
- **iOS real device: permission dialogs not armed from `onFlowStart`/`runFlow` `launchApp`** — `PrepareForFlow` scanned only the main flow body, so a `launchApp` with permissions declared in `onFlowStart` or a `runFlow` subflow never armed `defaultAlertAction` on a real device; system permission dialogs weren't auto-accepted and could wedge the device (diverging from the simulator). It now scans a flattened, execution-ordered view (`onFlowStart` + body, with `runFlow` subflows expanded and cycle-guarded), and warns when a real-device launch declares unsupported mixed permissions. Reported by [@seanadkinson](https://github.com/seanadkinson) ([#108](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/108)).
- **Variable interpolation in `repeat` `while:` conditions and `runScript` env** — `${output.*}`/`${VAR}` in a `repeat` `while:` selector are now expanded each iteration, and `runScript` env values are expanded before the script runs (matching `defineVariables`/`runFlow` and vanilla Maestro). `repeat` `times` and retry `maxRetries` now reject non-numeric values instead of silently defaulting to zero. Reported by [@pk1m](https://github.com/pk1m) ([#97](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/97)) and [@rafaelnobrekz](https://github.com/rafaelnobrekz) ([#107](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/107)).
- **WDA: surface closest on-screen texts on a missing text selector** — when a text selector isn't found, the page-source path now appends the closest on-screen texts (Dice-bigram ranked, quoted so PUA/invisible glyphs are visible) instead of masking the page-source error behind the WDA predicate error. Text matching also NFC-normalizes both sides so composed/decomposed accents match. Reported by [@HugoGresse](https://github.com/HugoGresse) ([#89](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/89)).
- **JUnit report flattened flow subdirectories** — the `file` property used `filepath.Base(SourceFile)`, collapsing e.g. `authentication/flow.yaml` to `flow.yaml` and breaking CI tools that locate the source by path. It is now reported relative to the working directory, preserving subdirectories. Reported by [@ceopaludetto](https://github.com/ceopaludetto) ([#96](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/96)).

### Changed
- **CI hardening** — migrated the deprecated `nhooyr.io/websocket` to `github.com/coder/websocket` (drop-in), cleared `golangci-lint` findings (`errcheck`, `gosimple`, `staticcheck`), and stabilized the headless Chromium browser tests on GitHub runners (disable the setuid sandbox under CI). No user-facing behavior change.

## [1.1.17] - 2026-06-12

A reporter-driven reliability release centred on Android tap/find correctness, plus a new Appium session-export hook. Headlines: elements living in a **separate window** — `AlertDialog`s, runtime-permission prompts, drawers, and Material dropdown/spinner popups — are now found instead of reported missing; taps can no longer fire **off-screen** from a malformed first-frame rect; the Android lazy tap-retry is **disabled by default** (it could re-tap across a navigation boundary onto the next screen); and live Appium sessions can be published to a well-known file for external tools.

### Added
- **`--appium-session-file <path>`** (env `MAESTRO_APPIUM_SESSION_FILE`) — publishes the live Appium session(s) (`sessionId` + `appiumUrl` per device) to a single JSON file so external tools can attach without polling report artifacts. Off by default. One entry per device (parallel runs share one file, no clobbering), new-session-per-flow updates in place, and the file is rewritten atomically (temp + rename) so readers never see a partial file. Requested by [@ssharma007-dev](https://github.com/ssharma007-dev) ([#91](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/91)).
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --driver appium --appium-session-file /tmp/sessions.json test flows/
  ```

### Fixed
- **DeviceLab Android: find elements inside dialogs / permission prompts / drawers** — the on-device agent searched only the focused window, so a control rendered in a separate accessibility window (e.g. an `AlertDialog`'s **OK**/**Discard** button, a runtime-permission prompt, or a drawer) was reported "not found" even though it was on screen. The agent now searches every window (topmost first) when the focused window misses. Bundled agent APK refreshed. Reported by [@simon-kuzin](https://github.com/simon-kuzin) ([#90](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/90)).
- **uiautomator2: dropdown / spinner popup items not in the hierarchy** — the default driver only exposed the focused window, so items in a Material `ExposedDropdownMenu`, a `Spinner`, or any `ListPopupWindow` (and `AlertDialog`s / permission prompts) were invisible and `tapOn` failed with "no such element" even with the popup on screen. maestro-runner now enables the server's `enableMultiWindows` setting, matching stock Maestro's all-windows traversal. Reported by [@ConorGarry](https://github.com/ConorGarry) ([#93](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/93)).
- **DeviceLab Android: off-screen tap from a malformed first-frame rect** — `FindAndClick` took its tap point from whatever rect the find returned; a just-opened bottom sheet's first laid-out frame could yield a clipped rect (top > bottom, negative height) or one translated below the viewport, so the tap fired off-screen and was lost, desyncing the flow. The tap path now rejects a non-positive-width/height or off-screen-centre rect and keeps polling for a settled frame (mirroring the assert-side viewport check). Reported by [@laiskajoonas](https://github.com/laiskajoonas) ([#94](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/94)).

### Changed
- **DeviceLab Android: lazy tap-retry disabled by default** — the lazy retry re-issued a tap when "the tree hash was unchanged since the tap and the target was still findable", treating that as "the tap had no effect". That predicate cannot distinguish a dropped tap from a successful one whose effect is async (submit-then-navigate) or that merely disables the source button, so it could re-issue a tap across a navigation boundary and land on the next screen's CTA. It is now off by default; opt back in with `MAESTRO_DEVICELAB_LAZY_RETRY=1`. Reported by [@laiskajoonas](https://github.com/laiskajoonas) ([#95](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/95)).

## [1.1.16] - 2026-05-31

Another reporter-driven reliability + parity release, with a notable new capability: an **experimental native iOS DeviceLab driver**. Headlines: `takeScreenshot` gains Maestro-compatible `cropOn` cropping across every driver, a new `--artifacts` flag controls when screenshots/hierarchy are captured, `setLocation` now works on iOS simulators, Android DeviceLab tap reliability on React Native navigation jumped from ~20/38 to 37/38 on the React Navigation example suite, and the iOS startup path is far more resilient under CI load.

### Added
- **`takeScreenshot` `cropOn` selector (all drivers)** — pass a selector under `cropOn` to crop the screenshot to the matched element's bounds instead of the whole screen. Same YAML shape as Maestro, so existing flows are portable. Element bounds are scaled to the captured image resolution (e.g. the DeviceLab Android agent downscales frames) before cropping, and the input image format is preserved. Reported by [@TheUltDev](https://github.com/TheUltDev) ([#88](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/88)).
  ```yaml
  - takeScreenshot:
      path: "login-button"
      cropOn:
        id: "login-button"
  ```
- **`--artifacts {always|on-failure|never}` flag** — controls when per-step screenshots and the UI hierarchy are captured. `on-failure` (default) keeps the previous behaviour; `always` captures before/after every step for visual debugging; `never` disables capture for the fastest, smallest reports.
- **iOS DeviceLab driver (experimental)** — a native XCUITest-based iOS driver, invoked with `--driver devicelab --platform ios`. The runner is vendored as source and built with Xcode on first run (cached per iOS version/device type afterwards), mirroring WDA. Passes the TestHive auth suite; still maturing versus WDA on complex React Native navigation, so **WDA remains the default and recommended iOS driver**.
- **`setLocation` on iOS simulators** — routes through `xcrun simctl location <udid> set <lat>,<lon>` (the same mechanism Maestro uses), on both the WDA and DeviceLab iOS drivers. Real iOS devices return an explicit "unsupported" error (Apple exposes no public GPS-override API for physical devices). Reported by [@HugoGresse](https://github.com/HugoGresse) ([#82](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/82)).
- **`--android-tcp-forward` flag** — forces TCP-to-TCP `adb forward` for the Android drivers, for sandboxed environments that block `localfilesystem:`/`localabstract:` forwards. Auto-enabled when `$DEVICEFARM_DEVICE_UDID` is present, fixing "server not ready" failures on AWS Device Farm. Reported by [@pk1m](https://github.com/pk1m) ([#83](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/83)).

### Changed
- **Android DeviceLab tap reliability on React Native navigation** — pre-tap settle is now applied to *all* tap selectors (ID-based taps used to bypass the settle path and could fire at mid-animation/off-screen bounds), plus a lazy-retry on `assertVisible`/`inputText` that re-issues a tap when the prior tap clearly had no effect. Took the React Navigation example E2E suite from ~20/38 to a steady 37/38.
- **Lazy-retry gated on tree-hash unchanged** — the lazy-retry now skips when the screen changed since the tap (e.g. a failed-login error rendering), eliminating a wasted retry window on flows whose tapped control legitimately persists. Cuts ~2s off negative-path flows (TestHive Invalid Password 9.5s → 7.4s) with no loss of the navigation reliability gains (37/38 unchanged).
- **iOS startup resilience under CI** — startup timeout raised to 600s and the simulator is now shutdown/booted between retry attempts to clear a wedged CoreSimulator daemon; both WDA and the iOS DeviceLab driver gained stall-detection that auto-retries a hung `xcodebuild` instead of waiting out the full timeout.
- **Appium honours user-set `appium:autoLaunch`** — the driver only forces `autoLaunch=false` when the caller hasn't specified it, so launch-time capabilities like `appium:processArguments` (e.g. `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` for Applitools NML) take effect again. Reported by [@kavithamahesh](https://github.com/kavithamahesh) ([#86](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/86)).
- **iOS alert handling default** — `alertAction` now defaults to empty (was implicitly "accept"); flows that don't configure permissions keep in-app alerts interactable, while explicit permission config still auto-accepts. Reported by [@j-ezeh](https://github.com/j-ezeh) ([#64](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/64)).
- **Appium driver is friendlier to locked-down hosts** (e.g. Sauce Labs) where local filesystem/port access is restricted.

### Fixed
- **Android file-picker taps (API 31+)** — the bundled DeviceLab agent was refreshed so the brief DOWN→UP touch duration is applied on all API levels, restoring the non-zero touch needed to dispatch open-document intents from `RecyclerView` file-picker items on Android 12+. Reported by [@LandonPatmore](https://github.com/LandonPatmore) ([#87](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/87)).
- **Android DeviceLab `displayed=false` filtering** — elements reported as not-visible-to-user are now skipped to match Maestro's pass-through behaviour (fixes false "element exists but is not visible" and material-top-tabs cases).
- **Case-insensitive regex selectors over-escaped** — `text: '.*For You.*'` was being treated as a literal string; regex metacharacters are no longer escaped in the `textMatches`/`descriptionMatches` fallback.

## [1.1.15] - 2026-05-19

A broad reliability + ergonomics release driven mostly by real-user reports across iOS, Android, Flutter and web. Highlights: assertVisible now recognises React Native container testIDs on iOS, Android scroll is rewired to `adb input swipe` for cross-skin reliability (OneUI in particular), `waitForAnimationToEnd` actually polls instead of returning 0 ms, web tap is gated by a Playwright-style actionability check, and browser console errors auto-surface in the flow report.

### Added
- **Web actionability gate before `tapOn` / `doubleTapOn` / `longPressOn` / `inputText`** — Playwright-style auto-wait MVP. After find-element and before dispatch, the runner now waits up to 2 s polling at 50 ms for the element to be enabled in three orthogonal senses: `HTMLElement.disabled !== true`, `aria-disabled !== "true"`, and `pointer-events !== "none"`. (Visibility is enforced upstream by the finder cascade — see the `findByAXTree` notes below.) Catches the common "looks tappable, isn't yet" flakes in modals, multi-step forms, and submit buttons that flip enabled on `change`. Stable-bounding-box polling is the next slice. When the gate times out, the error message now reports the specific rejection reason (e.g. `last rejection: pointer-events-none`).
- **Web: browser console errors + uncaught JS exceptions auto-surface in the flow report** — the CDP driver was already capturing `console.log/warn/error/info` and `Runtime.exceptionThrown` events, but they were only visible if the flow explicitly called `getConsoleLogs` / `assertNoJSErrors`. Now every flow gets a collapsed "Browser console" section in `report.html` (and a `consoleLogs` array in the per-flow JSON) with counts, colour coding, and full entries. Mobile drivers are unaffected.
- **Web: `failOnConsoleError` flow config** — opt-in stricter mode that fails the flow when any captured console error (or uncaught exception) fires during the run. Off by default.
- **`--user-data-dir` flag for persistent Chrome profile** (`MAESTRO_USER_DATA_DIR`) — reuse cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, and installed extensions across runs. Speeds up auth-heavy CI suites (log in once, reuse across flows) and supports flows that depend on installed extensions. Default unset → existing ephemeral-profile behaviour.
- **`--env-file` flag for `.env`-style environment loading** — loads `KEY=VALUE` pairs (with single/double quoting, `#` comments, blank-line skipping) into the flow runtime. Slots between workspace `Env:` block and `-e CLI` overrides, so precedence is workspace < env-file < `-e`. Lets CI keep secrets out of flow YAML.
- **`--driver-start-timeout <seconds>` flag** (`MAESTRO_DRIVER_START_TIMEOUT`) — overrides the 30 s hard-coded driver-start timeout for UIA2 / DeviceLab Android drivers. AWS Device Farm low-end Samsung devices take ~60–80 s for cold-path APK install + dex2oat + JVM warmup; the runner force-stopped them at +30 s every time. Default 0 keeps the existing 30 s behaviour. Reported by [@pk1m](https://github.com/pk1m) ([#76](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/76)).
- **`runFlow` with `when:` gets an `else:` branch** (parity fix) — three interchangeable YAML shapes (else as file, else as inline `commands:`, else inheriting parent file). Cleans up branching auth setups (run sign-in if not logged in, otherwise run the signed-in path) without a second top-level conditional.
- **`tapOn` / `longPressOn` / `tapOnPoint` accept `duration:` (ms)** (parity fix) — routes through each driver's long-press path. `tapOn.longPress: true` now works on UIA2 / DeviceLab / Appium too (was WDA-only), defaulting to 1000 ms. `longPressOn.duration` is also configurable (was hardcoded 1 s).
- **`openNotifications` step (Android)** (parity fix) — pulls down the notification shade via `cmd statusbar expand-notifications`. Dispatched by UIA2 + DeviceLab; no-op on iOS.
- **`removeMedia` step (Android)** (parity fix) — clears the MediaStore index for deterministic test setup. Symmetric with `addMedia`. Tries the modular provider first, falls back to legacy.
- **`scrollUntilVisible.direction` and `setAirplaneMode.enabled` support `${VAR}` interpolation** (parity fix) — values resolve at execute time, so the same flow YAML works across environments.
- **Pre-flight warning when `--app-file` looks like a Flutter debug build** — scans the `.app` bundle for `Frameworks/App.framework/flutter_assets/kernel_blob.bin` (the Dart kernel snapshot, present in debug, absent in release/profile AOT). Prints a yellow startup warning pointing at `flutter build ios --release/--profile`. Advisory only — unusual setups with a live `flutter run` daemon reachable from the test host can still succeed.
- **WDA crash-loop circuit breaker** — when the same client connects + dies repeatedly with no productive request in between, the runner now bails with a clear error instead of letting the retry storm fill the logs. Drove this through a real iPad Flutter crash that previously surfaced as silent log flooding. Reported by [@divan](https://github.com/divan) ([#38](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/38)).

### Fixed
- **iOS `assertVisible` by `id` for React Native container testIDs** (parity fix) — `assertVisible: { id: ... }` failed against `<View testID="…">` containers on both iOS simulator and real device. WDA's page-source filter rejected any element XCUITest reports as `visible="false"`, including RN wrapper views that have no own visual content but host visible children. Maestro CLI never consults that attribute, so the same flow worked on CLI. Added a phased visibility check: prefer `visible="true"` matches; fall back to `visible="false"` candidates only when they host at least one visible descendant — recovers RN container testIDs while still rejecting hidden-but-still-mounted screens. When the rescue path matches, the step result records `matchNote` in `report.json` and the step message becomes `Element is visible (matched via visible descendant …)`. Reported by [@AlonG-Papaya](https://github.com/AlonG-Papaya) ([#80](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/80)).
- **Android `scroll` / `scrollUntilVisible` on Samsung OneUI** (parity fix) — three compounding bugs caused `scrollUntilVisible` to either short-circuit without scrolling or report `Element not found after 20 scrolls` while the viewport never moved:
  1. `scrollUntilVisible` declared success when the target only existed in the off-screen portion of the view hierarchy. Now verifies the matched element actually overlaps the viewport.
  2. Both Android drivers routed scroll through gesture APIs that silently no-op on several Android skins (`/appium/gestures/scroll` on OneUI for the `uiautomator2` driver; the on-device agent's MotionEvent injection with zero-ms duration and inverted direction for the `devicelab` driver). The default scroll backend is now `adb input swipe` for both drivers — the same OS-level path you'd get from an `adb shell input swipe` call by hand. The agent itself was also corrected — `scroll` now uses scroll semantics (direction = what gets revealed), `swipe` keeps touch semantics (direction = finger motion), and `speed <= 0` is clamped to 300 ms. Bundled APK rebuilt.
  3. Infrastructure errors during element lookup (dead session, connection refused) were silently counted as "not found yet" and made failures surface as `Element not found after 20 scrolls`. Real errors now propagate immediately.

  The old gesture path is still available per step for users who need it:
  ```yaml
  - scrollUntilVisible:
      element: { id: "give feedback" }
      direction: DOWN
      engine: agent      # opt out of the default adb swipe
  ```

  Verified on a Samsung Galaxy M16 (OneUI, Android 14). Reported by [@George-Anton-Tarazi](https://github.com/George-Anton-Tarazi) ([#81](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/81)), with prior investigation in [#28](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/28) by [@maggialejandro](https://github.com/maggialejandro).
- **`waitForAnimationToEnd` actually waits** (parity fix) — the UIA2 / DeviceLab / WDA implementations were stubs that returned success in 0 ms (and logged "WARNING: not fully implemented"), making the step a no-op gate. The configured `timeout:` field was parsed but discarded. The step now polls two consecutive screenshots, computes the fraction of differing pixels, returns success once ≤ 0.5 % differ (i.e. screen is static), and respects `timeout:` everywhere (default 15 s). On timeout it soft-returns success so a never-settling animation doesn't block the surrounding flow. Web CDP path now honours the user-supplied timeout instead of a hardcoded 10 s.
- **Silent wrong-element tap for lazy ListView items on Android Flutter** (parity fix) — `tapOn: { id: "X" }` against an item in a `ListView`'s cache-extent buffer (laid out but not in the visible viewport) silently dispatched a coordinate tap at the cache item's bounds, which often fell inside the status / nav-bar safe area on top of an unrelated widget. Tests "passed" against the wrong target. The Flutter VM service path now rejects taps whose target lies in the top 3 % status bar or bottom 5 % nav / gesture area (or fully off-screen) and returns a clear error pointing at `scrollUntilVisible` as the fix.
- **Duplicate console events in per-flow report** — when `cfg.URL` was set, the CDP driver pre-navigated to that URL during construction, so console events from that load fired *before* the user's flow started. The flow's first `launchApp` re-navigated to the same URL and fired the same events again, producing duplicates (8 entries for 4 distinct events in the verified repro). The runner now resets the console buffer at flow start; mobile / native drivers that don't implement the reset interface are unaffected.
- **Web `tapOn` resolving to non-Element nodes (#text, `<title>`)** — on SPAs that put route labels into `document.title` (e.g. saucedemo, demoblaze), the AX-tree finder's accessible-name search returned a backend handle for the document title; the actionability gate rejected it but the find cascade had already committed to that element. Same shape for accessible names derived from a single child text node (`<button>Back to products</button>`) — the AX tree returned the `#text` node, which Rod's `Click()` can't dispatch on. `findByAXTree` now (a) skips non-renderable tags (`<title>`, `<script>`, etc.) and (b) walks up to the parent Element when the resolved handle isn't itself an Element. Surfaced by saucedemo and demoblaze regression flows.

## [1.1.14] - 2026-05-12

This release closes out the Flutter Web testing story. v1.1.13 fixed the *finding* layer (selectors traverse same-origin iframes, `index` is a first-class web selector). v1.1.14 completes it: selectors also pierce open shadow roots, `tapOn` dispatches at correct top-frame viewport coordinates when the target lives inside an iframe (with hit-target verification), the same path extends to `doubleTapOn` / `longPressOn` / `scrollUntilVisible`, visibility checks intersect iframe content viewports, and `tapOn` handles Flutter Web's `<flutter-view>` pointer-router glass pane that consumes trusted events before any third-party listener can observe them. A real Flutter Web user — [@richjun](https://github.com/richjun) — drove most of this with two substantial PRs ([#73](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/73), [#74](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/74)) and two issue reports ([#71](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/71), [#72](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/72)).

### Added
- **Selectors pierce open shadow roots on web** — `text` / CSS / `id` / attribute /
  role finders, plus the visibility and wait helpers, now recurse through
  every same-origin `<iframe>` *and* every open `shadowRoot` reachable from
  them. Flutter Web mounts its accessibility tree inside an open shadow root
  attached to `<flt-glass-pane>`, so `tapOn: "Close"` against a Flutter Web
  semantics node now resolves to the actual element. Closed shadow roots
  remain unreachable (same constraint every WebDriver-class tool has — no
  fix possible without privileged access). Reported by
  [@richjun](https://github.com/richjun) ([#71](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/71)).
- **`tapOn text + index` enumerates across iframes / shadow roots** —
  completes the [#67](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/67) fix from 1.1.13.
  Previously the resolver enumerated matches only within the top frame, so
  asking for index 1 when matches 0..N-1 lived in the top frame and the
  real target lived in an iframe silently re-tapped the in-range top-frame
  match — green test, wrong button. Now walks every same-origin root via
  `_collectRoots()`, sorts by document order, and indexes deterministically.
  Out-of-range returns a precise error with the actual match count instead
  of falling back. Reported by [@richjun](https://github.com/richjun)
  ([#72](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/72)).
- **`tapOn` dispatches at top-frame coordinates for iframe-nested targets** —
  Rod's `Element.Click()` used iframe-LOCAL viewport coordinates from
  `getBoundingClientRect()`; CDP `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` operates in
  TOP-FRAME viewport coordinates. The click landed at the wrong place and
  `tapOn` reported success silently. Now ports Playwright's
  `_checkFrameIsHitTarget` walk: from the target outward, adds each
  ancestor `<iframe>` element's box plus its content-area inset (border +
  padding) to convert iframe-local → top-frame viewport coordinates.
  Hit-target verification runs as both static pre-flight (rejects
  occluded / wrong-element clicks before dispatch) and post-click trusted-
  event capture (verifies the click landed on the target's frame tree).
  Contributed by [@richjun](https://github.com/richjun) in
  [#73](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/73).
- **`doubleTapOn` / `longPressOn` / `scrollUntilVisible` inherit the
  iframe-coord-translated path** — same root cause as `tapOn` had. Now
  routed through a shared `dispatchCrossRoot` helper. `scrollUntilVisible`
  for iframe-nested targets calls native `Element.scrollIntoView()` inside
  the element's own document (the previous page-level `Mouse.Scroll` only
  scrolled the outer document and never reached iframe content).
- **Visibility check intersects iframe content viewport** —
  `_isElementVisible` used to do intrinsic-only checks (computed style +
  `getBoundingClientRect()` dimensions) and reported elements scrolled or
  clipped outside their iframe's content viewport as "visible." This made
  `assertVisible` / `waitForVisible` / `extendedWaitUntil` silently pass
  on iframe-clipped elements, and made `scrollUntilVisible`'s loop exit
  on iteration 0 (the new `scrollIntoView` branch was unreachable in
  practice). Now walks the iframe ancestor chain at each level,
  intersecting with the iframe's content viewport. Empty intersection
  returns false; surviving rect is translated to parent coordinates and
  rechecked. Top-frame "below the fold" elements stay visible — only
  iframe clipping is added.
- **`tapOn` into Flutter Web semantics** — three orthogonal fixes for
  Flutter Web targets. `findBySearch` now rejects non-tappable text
  containers (`<script>` / `<style>` / `<template>` / etc.) because CDP
  `DOM.performSearch` matches against serialized HTML and Flutter Web
  pages whose JS source contains the button label as a string literal
  silently returned the `<script>` element. The hit-target pre-flight
  and post-click verifier both accept the Flutter `<flutter-view>` glass-
  pane occlusion case (target + topmost hit both inside `<flutter-view>`);
  Flutter intercepts trusted pointer events at the document/glass-pane
  capture layer and routes them through its own internal pointer router
  for semantics dispatch, so the verifier's one-shot listener never fires
  and a strict same-element walk-up always reports false occlusion. Non-
  Flutter occlusion (overlay div, modal, genuine z-stack) continues to
  fail-fast — the Occluded and Transformed regression tests still reject.

  [#74](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/74).

### Fixed
- **`runScript` per-call scope + persistent `output` mutations** — two
  related bugs. (a) top-level `const` / `let` / `function` declarations
  collided across `runScript` calls because the JS engine reused a single
  Goja runtime's global scope, surfacing as
  `SyntaxError: Identifier 'word' has already been declared` on the second
  invocation. Each `runScript` now executes inside an IIFE so top-level
  declarations are function-scoped to that invocation. (b) Mutations like
  `output.list.push(x)` did not persist across `runScript` calls because
  the `output` proxy returned a snapshot Go map per call — only whole-
  value reassignment (`output.list = [...]`) survived. The `output` bag
  is now a Goja-native `Object` shared across invocations so mutations
  persist. Reported by [@Sina-KH](https://github.com/Sina-KH)
  ([#70](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/70)).
- **iOS `openLink` on simulator** — `POST /session/<sid>/url` on
  WebDriverAgent v12+ returns `Unhandled endpoint: /url`. Users who ran
  `maestro-runner wda update` and got the newer WDA hit a hard failure
  on every `openLink` step, blocking Expo dev client flows where deep
  linking loads the JS bundle from Metro. Bypassed entirely on
  simulators by shelling out to `xcrun simctl openurl <udid> <url>` —
  same primitive Maestro CLI uses, faster, no WDA version coupling.
  Real iOS devices keep the existing WDA `/url` path (`simctl` can't
  reach them). Reported by [@jongbelegen](https://github.com/jongbelegen)
  ([#68](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/68)).
- **iOS `clearState` on simulator no longer requires `--app-file`** —
  the runner needs to uninstall + reinstall the app to wipe its data
  container (Apple doesn't expose a "clear data only" API). Previously
  failed with either `clearState on iOS requires --app-file` (no
  `--app-file`) or `lstat ... No such file or directory` (if
  `--app-file` pointed inside the live sim container, which the
  uninstall deleted before install could read it). Now auto-discovers
  the installed `.app` via `xcrun simctl get_app_container` and copies
  it to a temp directory before the uninstall — same approach Maestro
  CLI uses (`LocalSimulatorUtils.kt#reinstallApp`). Reported by
  [@jongbelegen](https://github.com/jongbelegen)
  ([#69](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/69)).

## [1.1.13] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Same-origin iframe traversal on web** — text/CSS/ID/attribute selectors now
  walk into same-origin `<iframe>` content (e.g. Flutter Web embedded under a
  host page). Cross-origin / OOPIF iframes are still skipped, but the
  not-found error now surfaces a clear `(skipped N cross-origin iframes — full
  OOPIF support not implemented yet)` hint so users debugging a missing
  selector can tell the cause is frame isolation, not a typo. Reported by
  [@richjun](https://github.com/richjun) ([#65](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/65)).
- **Mobile-style `index` selector on web** — `tapOn: { text: "Help", index: 1 }`
  now picks the second match instead of being silently dropped as
  unsupported. The web finder accepts both `index` (string, mobile-style) and
  `nth` (int) via a single `EffectiveNth()` helper, so the same flow YAML
  works across Android, iOS, and web. Reported by
  [@richjun](https://github.com/richjun) ([#67](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/67)).
- **Sauce Labs job context per flow** — the runner now posts
  `sauce:context` to Sauce on every flow start so jobs surface the YAML
  basename in the Sauce UI, and renames empty / "Default Appium Test" jobs
  on completion using the first flow's filename. Real-device caps without
  `appium:jobUuid` fall back to VMS + session id so REST status updates
  still target the right job. Contributed by
  [@eyaly](https://github.com/eyaly) ([#66](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/66)).

### Fixed
- **`onFlowStart` hook with default `appId`** — `launchApp` (and other app
  lifecycle steps) inside `onFlowStart` / `onFlowComplete` now resolve the
  flow's default `appId` the same way as top-level steps. Previously the
  hook ran with an empty `AppID`, causing a silent no-op on Android. Fixes
  [#62](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/62), reported
  by [@zcsteele](https://github.com/zcsteele).
- **`copyTextFrom` on Appium 3.x** — stop pushing the captured text to the
  device clipboard via `POST /appium/device/set_clipboard`, which Appium 3
  returns 404 for. The runner already keeps the value in memory (matching
  Maestro's design) so `pasteText` continues to work. Fixes
  [#61](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/61), reported
  by [@kavithamahesh](https://github.com/kavithamahesh).
- **iOS permission dialogs blocking real-device flows** — WDA's alerts
  monitor only registers when `defaultAlertAction` is in the session-creation
  capabilities; the runner now defaults to `accept` so notification (and
  other) permission dialogs auto-dismiss out of the box. Fixes
  [#64](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/64), reported
  by [@j-ezeh](https://github.com/j-ezeh).
- **assertVisible silently wrong for state filters / nth / role** — the JS
  fast path bypassed several capabilities the Go finder already implemented,
  so selectors with `enabled` / `checked` / `focused` / `nth` / `role` /
  ID-cascade hit the fast path and produced wrong answers. Centralised
  routing now sends those selectors to the Go finder; the JS path's `id`
  case also runs the same `data-testid` / `name` / `aria-label` cascade.

## [1.1.12] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Tap options** — `repeat`, `delay`, `retryTapIfNoChange`, and `waitToSettleTimeoutMs` now
  honored during execution on all drivers (uiautomator2, wda, devicelab, appium, cdp).
  Implemented at the executor layer, zero driver-side changes.
  ([#52](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/52), [#53](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/53))
  ```yaml
  - tapOn:
      id: "login-button"
      repeat: 3
      delay: 500
      retryTapIfNoChange: true
      waitToSettleTimeoutMs: 2000
  ```
- **runFlow timeout** — `timeout:` parameter on `runFlow` steps with context propagation
  into driver polling loops. Element-finding cancels immediately on expiry, and failures
  are classified as `TIMEOUT` in reports. Ref
  [#29](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/29), thanks to
  [@maraujop](https://github.com/maraujop) for the suggestion.
  ```yaml
  - runFlow:
      file: common/login.yaml
      timeout: 5000
      env:
        username: devicelab
  ```
- **Cloud Provider lifecycle hooks** — `Provider` interface now exposes `OnRunStart`,
  `OnFlowStart`, and `OnFlowEnd` alongside the existing `ExtractMeta` and `ReportResult`.
  Cloud integrations can update dashboards live per-flow instead of only at run end.
  Sauce Labs ships with no-op placeholders for the new hooks.
- **UI.waitForSettle RPC** — on-device tree-comparison settle detection on the DeviceLab
  Android driver, used as an auto-settle before `inputText` / `eraseText` to avoid key
  events firing mid-transition.
- **Clickable-ancestor promotion** — when a DeviceLab tap matches text on a non-clickable
  descendant (e.g. `"Sign In"` TextView inside a clickable login-button `ViewGroup`), the
  agent now walks up to the nearest clickable ancestor.
- **hintText matching** — `hintContains` / `hintMatches` UiSelector extensions on the
  DeviceLab driver match an `EditText`'s `android:hint` placeholder. Lets
  `tapOn: "Email"` find an empty email field by its hint.
- **Case-insensitive text matching on Android** — `textContains` / `descriptionContains`
  now fall back to case-insensitive match when case-sensitive fails, fixing Android dialog
  buttons where `textAllCaps` displays `"CANCEL"` but the view hierarchy text is
  `"Cancel"`. Reported by [@satya164](https://github.com/satya164).
- **Appium parallel execution** — run flows across N Appium sessions concurrently. Each
  session connects to the same Appium URL; the server allocates devices.
  ([#47](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/47))
- **`--wda-bundle-id` flag** — custom WebDriverAgent bundle identifier for signing
  scenarios where the default bundle id isn't usable.
  ([#48](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/48))
- **Device info in Appium reports** — device info and session ID now surface in console
  output and JUnit/Allure reports for Appium runs.

### Changed
- **Simpler `inputText` without selector** — DeviceLab and UIAutomator2 drivers now send
  key events directly via `SendKeyActions` instead of attempting
  `findFocused` / `ActiveElement` fallbacks. Matches Maestro's "type into whatever the OS
  has focused" behavior.
- Updated DeviceLab Android driver APK to ship `UI.waitForSettle`, clickable-ancestor
  promotion, and hintText predicate support.
- Appium parallel session count is capped at the number of flows (prints a warning
  when parallel count exceeds flow count).

### Fixed
- **iOS install hang on iOS 17+ / iOS 26** — prefer `xcrun devicectl device install app`
  over the legacy `go-ios` zipconduit path on real devices. Both paths now run under a
  3-minute context timeout so a stuck install surfaces as an error instead of an infinite
  spinner. Escape hatch via `MAESTRO_RUNNER_IOS_INSTALLER=zipconduit|devicectl`. Fixes
  [#54](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/54), thanks to
  [@ptmkenny](https://github.com/ptmkenny) for the clear repro.
- **`clearKeychain` on iOS** — standalone `clearKeychain` step and
  `launchApp { clearKeychain: true }` both now work. Previously the step erred with
  `Step type '*flow.ClearKeychainStep' is not supported on iOS`, and the `launchApp`
  flag was a silent no-op (users stayed logged in). On simulators runs
  `xcrun simctl keychain <udid> reset`; on real devices returns a clear unsupported
  message pointing to `clearState` as the alternative. Fixes
  [#57](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/57), thanks to
  [@ross-aker](https://github.com/ross-aker) for reporting.
- **Swipe `LEFT` / `RIGHT` on Android** — use screen coordinates directly instead of the
  previous element-relative computation that misbehaved.
- **`when: { true: <expr> }` silently always-true** — the `true:` field wasn't parsed
  (YAML tag bound to the internal `scriptCondition` name instead), so conditions were
  ignored and commands always ran. Fixes
  [#60](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/60), reported by
  [@satya164](https://github.com/satya164) and
  [@kavithamahesh](https://github.com/kavithamahesh).
- **Env var default syntax** — `${VAR || "default"}` and `${VAR ?? "fallback"}` now
  resolve correctly. Undefined JS variables auto-define as `undefined` on
  `ReferenceError`, matching Maestro's GraalJS Proxy behavior. Fixes
  [#49](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/49),
  [#50](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/50).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Cloud provider abstraction** — automatic detection and result reporting for cloud device providers (Sauce Labs, BrowserStack, LambdaTest, etc.) when using the Appium driver. Test pass/fail status, flow results, and metadata are reported to the provider after the run completes. Based on [@eyaly](https://github.com/eyaly)'s Sauce Labs integration ([#43](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/43), [#45](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/45))
  ```bash
  # Sauce Labs — automatically detected from the Appium URL
  maestro-runner --driver appium --appium-url "https://ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/wd/hub" \
    --caps caps.json test flows/
  ```
- **Source file path in FlowResult** — each flow result now includes the path to the source YAML file, used by cloud providers and report consumers

### Changed
- Updated DeviceLab Android driver APK with latest on-device agent
- Airplane mode commands now use `cmd connectivity airplane-mode enable/disable` (Android 11+) instead of the legacy `settings put global airplane_mode_on` approach

### Fixed
- **CDP `waitForPageReady` crash** — replaced panicking `MustWaitLoad()` with error-handling `WaitLoad()` in the browser CDP driver, preventing test run crashes on pages with deeply nested object references
- Removed unused `freePort()` function from DeviceLab WebView driver
- Removed unused regex variables (`reLabel`, `reHint`, `reValue`) from Flutter semantics parser
- Tightened variable scope in Flutter widget tree parser

### Contributors

1. Implemented original Sauce Labs pass/fail reporting integration ([#43](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/43)), which formed the basis for the cloud provider abstraction in [#45](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/45)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **WebView CDP support for Android** — the DeviceLab driver now connects to WebViews via Chrome DevTools Protocol for element finding and JavaScript execution, instead of relying solely on the native UiAutomator accessibility tree
  ```bash
  # Automatic — when a WebView is detected, CDP is used transparently
  maestro-runner --driver devicelab test webview-flow.yaml
  ```
- **Chrome browser CDP on Android** — the DeviceLab driver can now automate Chrome browser on Android devices via CDP, enabling web testing on real Android devices
- **`evalWebViewScript` command** — execute inline JavaScript in a mobile WebView via CDP. Returns the result as a string, optionally stored in an output variable
  ```yaml
  # Inline script
  - evalWebViewScript: "return document.title"

  # With output variable
  - evalWebViewScript:
      script: "return document.querySelector('#price').textContent"
      output: price

  # Use the result
  - assertTrue: ${price == '$7.50'}
  ```
- **`runWebViewScript` command** — load and execute a JavaScript file in a mobile WebView via CDP. Supports environment variables injected as `window.__env`
  ```yaml
  # Simple file execution
  - runWebViewScript: scripts/extract-data.js

  # With environment variables and output
  - runWebViewScript:
      file: scripts/validate-cart.js
      env:
        EXPECTED_TOTAL: "29.99"
      output: validationResult
  ```
- **Network idle detection and DOM stability waits** — after navigations (in both browser and WebView contexts), maestro-runner now waits for network idle and DOM stability before proceeding, reducing flakiness on pages with async loading
- **CDP RAF-based visibility polling** — browser commands now use `requestAnimationFrame`-based polling for element visibility, improving reliability for dynamically rendered content
- **CDP `<select>` option support** — `tapOn` with option elements now correctly selects the option via JavaScript instead of attempting a click
- **CDP JS click fallback** — when a native click fails on a browser element, falls back to JavaScript `.click()` for better reliability with overlapping elements

### Changed
- Default WDA swipe duration changed from 300ms to 100ms for faster, more responsive swipe gestures on iOS
- JavaScript helper code extracted from Go string literals into dedicated embedded `.js` files for easier maintenance ([#37](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/37))

### Fixed
- **Swipe coordinates now match Maestro behavior** across all drivers (UIAutomator2, DeviceLab, WDA, Appium) — previously, swipe start/end positions differed from Maestro's implementation
- **`assertNotVisible` now correctly polls for disappearance** instead of polling for appearance — previously, the command would pass immediately if the element wasn't visible, without waiting for it to disappear after an action
- **Filter out-of-bounds elements from page source searches** — elements with coordinates outside the visible screen bounds are now excluded from search results, preventing false matches on off-screen elements ([#39](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/39))
- **Text node attribute error** — fixed `TypeError: this.getAttribute is not a function` when browser CDP encounters text nodes that don't have HTML attributes ([#35](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/35), [#36](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/pull/36))
- **iOS WDA session lifecycle** — improved driver reliability with better session creation, cleanup, and error recovery
- **`--team-id` no longer required for auto-detected simulators** — when a booted simulator is auto-detected, `--team-id` is automatically skipped since simulators don't need code signing
  ```bash
  # Before: required --team-id even when simulator is already booted
  # Now: just works
  maestro-runner --platform ios test flow.yaml
  ```
- **Flutter reconnection** — skip retries for non-Flutter apps instead of wasting time on connection attempts. Non-Flutter apps now pay zero retry cost
- **WebView CDP forwarder** — wired `SetWebViewForwarder` in the DeviceLab driver, which was never connected — elements were previously found only via native UiAutomator accessibility tree even when a WebView was present
- **hideKeyboard reliability** — on-device agent now uses `KEYCODE_ESCAPE` first (keyboard-only, no navigation side-effects), falls back to `KEYCODE_BACK` if needed. Retries up to 3 times with keyboard visibility polling
- **In-WebView navigation** — when visibility check fails during in-WebView page navigation (JS context destroyed), refreshes page reference and retries instead of skipping CDP entirely
- **CDP text match filtering** — text-based visibility checks (`text`, `textContains`, `textRegex`) now filter to the deepest matching element, preventing false positives from ancestor elements whose `textContent` includes hidden children's text

## [1.0.9] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- `sleep` command — pause execution for a given number of milliseconds. Supports scalar (`- sleep: 500`) and mapping syntax
- `isKeyboardVisible` command — query whether the soft keyboard is currently shown. Returns result in `CommandResult.Data` (boolean). Available via YAML, JSON, and REST API
- `hideKeyboard` strategy field — specify `strategy: appium|escape|esc|back` to force a specific dismissal method instead of trying all three
- `KeyboardVisible` field added to `StateSnapshot` for richer state introspection
- REST API server (`maestro-runner server`) — session-based HTTP server for executing Maestro steps via JSON instead of YAML flow files. Supports session management, screenshots, view hierarchy, and device info. Configurable port via `--port` flag or `MAESTRO_SERVER_PORT` env var
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --platform android server --port 9999
  ```
- JSON step unmarshaling (`pkg/flow/json.go`) — all step types can now be deserialized from JSON, enabling the REST API execute endpoint
- JSON struct tags on all flow step types and Selector for proper serialization/deserialization
- **Desktop browser testing** — new `--platform web` with built-in CDP driver for Chrome/Chromium. Headless by default, `--headed` for visible browser. Supports parallel browser execution
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --platform web test flow.yaml
  maestro-runner --platform web --headed --browser chrome test flow.yaml
  maestro-runner --platform web test --parallel 3 flows/
  ```
- **Browser-specific commands** — `evalBrowserScript`, `setCookies`, `getCookies`, `saveAuthState`, `loadAuthState`, `openTab`, `switchTab`, `closeTab`, `mockNetwork`, `blockNetwork`, `setNetworkConditions`, `waitForRequest`, `clearNetworkMocks`, `uploadFile`, `waitForDownload`, `grantPermissions`, `resetPermissions`, `getConsoleLogs`, `clearConsoleLogs`, `assertNoJSErrors`, `runBrowserScript`
- **Browser selectors** — `css` and `xpath` selectors for web elements, in addition to `text` and `id`
  ```yaml
  - tapOn:
      css: "button.submit"
  - inputText:
      id: "username"
      text: "hello"
  ```
- `--no-app-install` flag — skip app installation even if `--app-file` is provided. Useful when the app is already installed
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --no-app-install --app-file app.apk test flow.yaml
  ```
- `--no-driver-install` flag — skip driver installation (UIAutomator2, WDA, DeviceLab). Useful when drivers are already installed on the device
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --no-driver-install test flow.yaml
  ```
- Flutter VM Service fallback for element finding — when the native driver (WDA/UIAutomator2) can't find a Flutter element, automatically discovers the Dart VM Service and searches the semantics/widget trees in parallel. Works on Android and iOS simulators. Non-Flutter apps pay only one log read on first miss, then fully bypassed. Disable with `--no-flutter-fallback`
- Flutter widget tree cross-reference — when semantics tree search fails, falls back to widget tree analysis (hint text, identifiers, suffix icons) and cross-references with semantics nodes for coordinates
- DeviceLab Android driver — WebSocket-based on-device automation with bounds stabilization for animated elements and special character handling. ~2x faster than UIAutomator2
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --driver devicelab --platform android test flow.yaml
  ```
- `setAirplaneMode` and `toggleAirplaneMode` commands for iOS (WDA) — automates the Settings app to toggle airplane mode on real devices. Supports both mapping and scalar syntax
  ```yaml
  # Mapping syntax
  - setAirplaneMode:
      enabled: true

  # Scalar syntax
  - setAirplaneMode: enabled
  - setAirplaneMode: disabled

  # Toggle (flips current state)
  - toggleAirplaneMode
  ```
- `maxTypingFrequency` support for WDA (iOS) — configurable typing speed via `--typing-frequency` flag. Default: 30 keys/sec (WDA default is 60). Useful for React Native apps where the JS bridge can't keep up at full speed
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --typing-frequency 15 test flow.yaml
  ```
  ```yaml
  # Or set per-flow in YAML config section:
  appId: com.example.app
  typingFrequency: 20
  ---
  - inputText: "hello world"
  ```
- `maxScrolls` and `timeout` fields wired up in `scrollUntilVisible` for all 4 drivers — previously parsed but ignored, now each driver uses dual-condition loop (max scrolls AND timeout)
  ```yaml
  - scrollUntilVisible:
      element:
        text: "Sign Out"
      direction: "down"
      maxScrolls: 5
      timeout: 10000
  ```
- On-failure WebView detection with CDP-aware error enrichment — background CDP socket monitor with push event architecture
- Regex pattern support for ID selectors across all drivers — use regex patterns like wildcards, alternation, and character classes in `id` selectors
  ```yaml
  # Wildcard
  - tapOn:
      id: "username-.*"

  # Alternation
  - assertVisible:
      id: "(username|email)-input"

  # Suffix anchor
  - tapOn:
      id: "login.*-button$"
  ```
- `repeat` with `while` condition now loops correctly instead of executing only once. Supports configurable timeout for the condition check
  ```yaml
  - repeat:
      while:
        visible: "Delete"
        timeout: 2000    # ms to wait before declaring element gone
      commands:
        - tapOn: "Delete"
  ```
- Cloud Providers section in README with TestingBot setup guide

### Fixed
- iOS simulator no longer requires `--team-id` — simulators don't need code signing, so the validation now only enforces `--team-id` for real devices
  ```bash
  # Before: required --team-id even for simulators
  # Now: just works
  maestro-runner --platform ios --start-simulator <UDID> test flow.yaml
  ```
- `runFlow: when` conditions with variable expressions (e.g., `${output.element.id}`) were never expanded, causing conditions to always evaluate as false and silently skip conditional blocks
- iOS real device: `acceptAlertButtonSelector` matched "Don't Allow" instead of "Allow" — `CONTAINS[c] 'Allow'` matched both buttons, causing WDA to reject permission dialogs. Changed to `BEGINSWITH[c] 'Allow'` with `OK` fallback for older iOS versions
- `AllocatePort` was ignoring existing port allocations and `assertCondition` had duplicate `timeout` yaml tag
- `repeat` with `while` condition executed only once instead of looping
- `repeat-while` condition check timeout reduced from 17s to 7s default
- Implicit wait warning resolved by using Appium settings endpoint
- `assertVisible` optional timeout and optimized tap element finding
- WDA `launchApp` optimized: parallel permissions and removed sleeps
- Element finding consolidated: single query with prefetched element name, merged WDA session settings into single HTTP call
- Android `setAirplaneMode`/`toggleAirplaneMode` failed with `SecurityException: Permission Denial` on Android 7+ — `am broadcast` requires system-level permissions. Now uses `cmd connectivity airplane-mode` on Android 11+ (no root needed), with `settings put` + broadcast fallback for older versions ([#27](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/27))

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Appium driver: `newSession` option for `launchApp` — creates a fresh Appium session, useful when `clearState` fails on real iOS devices (`mobile: clearApp` unsupported). On iOS real devices with `newSession: true`, `clearState` is skipped since a fresh session already provides clean state ([#14](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/14))
  ```yaml
  - launchApp:
      appId: com.example.app
      newSession: true
  ```
- Bundled UIAutomator2 server upgraded from v9.9.0 to v9.11.1 with new LaunchApp endpoint (`getLaunchIntentForPackage` + `startActivity`)
- Android: classify error types in report (`element_not_found`, `timeout`, `assertion`, `keyboard_covering`, etc.) for better debugging
- Android: detect keyboard covering elements after `inputText`/`inputRandom` — when the soft keyboard covers a target element, taps land on the keyboard instead of the element. Now detects this with a clear error message suggesting `- hideKeyboard`
- Auto-create iOS simulators when not enough shutdown simulators exist for `--parallel` — created simulators are automatically deleted on shutdown
- Parallel device selection: in-use detection via WDA port check (iOS) and socket check (Android) to skip devices already claimed by another maestro-runner instance

### Fixed
- iOS real device: `clearState` no longer kills WDA connection — replaced `go-ios` (`installationproxy`/`zipconduit` over usbmuxd) with `xcrun devicectl` (over Apple's `remoted` daemon), which doesn't interfere with USB port forwarding
- Android: `scroll` and `scrollUntilVisible` direction was inverted — `scroll down` was scrolling up because `/appium/gestures/scroll` already uses scroll semantics, no inversion needed ([#9](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/9))
- Android: `launchApp` failed with "No apps can perform this action" on certain devices — `resolve-activity` was called without `-a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER` flags. New three-tier launch strategy: (1) UIAutomator2 server `getLaunchIntentForPackage()` on-device, (2) shell fallback with proper flags + `dumpsys` parsing + API-level-aware `am start`, (3) monkey fallback ([#15](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/15))
- Android: server APK install now checks version and handles signing conflicts (uninstall + reinstall when version mismatches)
- `index` selector was ignored in simple (non-relative) selectors — `tapOn: text: X, index: 1` always tapped the first match because native driver APIs return only a single element. Now selectors with a non-zero `index` route through page source parsing, which returns all matches and picks the Nth one
- `-e` env variables were not expanding in flow config `appId` — `appId: ${APP_ID}` with `-e APP_ID=com.myapp` sent the literal `${APP_ID}` to adb. Now expands using `ExpandVariables()` before setting as a variable ([#12](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/12))
- Parallel device selection: devices are now filtered by platform (excludes tvOS/watchOS/xrOS) and in-use devices are skipped ([#11](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/11))
- Android: emulator port allocation skipped ports occupied by running emulators
- CLI: flags must come before flow paths in command examples

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- iOS WDA: off-screen elements no longer returned by `findElement` — `assertVisible`, `tapOn`, `scrollUntilVisible`, and all element commands now correctly reject elements not visible in the viewport
- iOS WDA: `scrollUntilVisible` no longer skips scrolling when the target element exists in the accessibility tree but is off-screen
- iOS WDA: `scrollUntilVisible` direction matching is now case-insensitive (e.g., `direction: "DOWN"` works)
- iOS WDA: `waitForIdleTimeout` now works on iOS via WDA quiescence
- `when: platform` condition was ignored in `runFlow` blocks ([#8](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/8))

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- `tapOn: point` now supports absolute pixel coordinates (e.g., `point: "286, 819"`) in addition to percentages
- Coordinate validation: negative values, out-of-bounds pixels, and percentage range (0-100%) are all rejected with clear error messages
- Screen size cached at session startup instead of fetching on every tap/swipe/scroll
- `launchApp: environment` for passing environment variables via WDA `launchEnvironment`

### Changed
- Extracted shared helpers (`ParsePointCoords`, `ParsePercentageCoords`, `RandomString`, `SuccessResult`, etc.) from drivers into `pkg/core`
- Removed hardcoded 1080x1920 screen size fallback in UIAutomator2 scroll/swipe

### Fixed
- `launchApp: arguments` silently failed on real iOS devices — early return after session creation, unpopulated env map, activate vs launch, missing variable expansion
- Removed unused AI flags (`--analyze`, `--api-url`, `--api-key`)

### Added
- `keyPress` option for character-by-character text input on Android
- Stale socket cleanup on force-stop (Ctrl+C / kill -9) with PID-based locking

### Fixed
- iOS Appium driver: element finding and tap reliability (use `label` instead of `content-desc` for accessibility)
- iOS Appium driver: `pressKey` command support
- iOS Appium driver: `tapOn` and `inputText` reliability improvements
- iOS Appium driver: skip `--app-file` and `--team-id` pre-checks (not needed for Appium)

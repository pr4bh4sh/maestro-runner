## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- `tapOn: point` now supports absolute pixel coordinates (e.g., `point: "286, 819"`) in addition to percentages
- Coordinate validation: negative values, out-of-bounds pixels, and percentage range (0-100%) are all rejected with clear error messages
- Screen size cached at session startup instead of fetching on every tap/swipe/scroll
- `launchApp: environment` for passing environment variables via WDA `launchEnvironment`

### Changed
- Extracted shared helpers (`ParsePointCoords`, `ParsePercentageCoords`, `RandomString`, `SuccessResult`, etc.) from drivers into `pkg/core`
- Removed hardcoded 1080x1920 screen size fallback in UIAutomator2 scroll/swipe

### Fixed
- `launchApp: arguments` silently failed on real iOS devices — early return after session creation, unpopulated env map, activate vs launch, missing variable expansion
- Removed unused AI flags (`--analyze`, `--api-url`, `--api-key`)

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `keyPress` option for character-by-character text input on Android
- Stale socket cleanup on force-stop (Ctrl+C / kill -9) with PID-based locking

### Fixed
- iOS Appium driver: element finding and tap reliability (use `label` instead of `content-desc` for accessibility)
- iOS Appium driver: `pressKey` command support
- iOS Appium driver: `tapOn` and `inputText` reliability improvements
- iOS Appium driver: skip `--app-file` and `--team-id` pre-checks (not needed for Appium)
- iOS Appium driver: skip `clearState` on real devices (`mobile: clearApp` only works on simulators)
- iOS WDA driver: auto-alert handling on simulators (accept/dismiss permission dialogs)
- `takeScreenshot` command now correctly saves PNG files
- GitHub star link in HTML report
- All `errcheck` violations fixed with proper error logging
